A script to easily convert MangaKatana downloaded zips into PDFs. This is my first time programming in shell, so it's far from perfect.

## Instructions for use
First you need to have your zip files that contains many folders with images, stored in different folders (The folder name doesn't matter).

Then, from outside the folder, execute the command. After unzip the files, a message will appear, so you write the name of the pdf.

The "Zips in folder..." text is a help to read the name of what you are converting to pdf. Once you have written the name, the pdf will be created.
